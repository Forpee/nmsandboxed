          South African born Sculptor, Nicolas Lehmann, works between his
          industrial art studios in Cape Town South Africa and Europe. Lehmann
          is a creative auto-didact coming from a family of artisans. Lehmann’s
          family is originally German. Mostly self-taught, time and passion have
          forged his enthusiasm to pursue mastering the challenging mediums of
          steel and bronze. Lehmann is one of the rare artist whom creates
          designs and casts his bronzes, in his own foundry. Married to French
          spouse, with residence in Saint Paul de Vence, Nicolas has retained
          his international ties and continues to seize the moment and
          inspirations.

          Inspired by nature and people, Lehmann started in 1995 with his
          sculptural work. He has never ceased to forge, twist, and shape forms
          and figurines. His material medium has varied from recycled steel to
          bronze. In the last decade, Lehmann has opened his own foundry in his

          Lehmann’s sculpture are all individually crafted. He is one of the
          only artist’s to cast his own bronzes.
